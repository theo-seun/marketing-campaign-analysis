## Key Insights from the Marketing Campaign Analysis

- **Top Performing Cities**  
  The top 10 cities with the highest number of campaigns were analyzed.  
  Some cities achieved high ROI but lower conversion rates, showing strong spending efficiency in specific locations.

- **Campaign Duration Analysis**  
  There is a non-linear relationship between campaign duration and performance.  
  Extremely short or long campaigns underperform compared to those with moderate lengths.

- **Customer Segment Performance**  
  Conversion rates and ROI differ by customer segment.  
  Some segments are significantly more profitable and should be prioritized in future targeting strategies.

- **Efficiency Trade-offs**  
  High conversion rates don’t always mean high ROI.  
  It’s important to balance both metrics when judging campaign success.
